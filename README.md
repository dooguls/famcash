Android app to track family allowances

App is dev is just getting started. I have a long list of features I want to build, but this is my first android app so it's going to take a while to build it all. 

Intended feature list
=====================
* select tasks to award 
* write value/status to local database
* award arbitrary money for tasks
* add new tasks
* add new family members
* track loaned money
-- display current money in DB
-- subtract requested money
* monthly report
* share events
-- via email
-- via twitter
-- via google+
-- via facebook
* echo settings to the cloud
* echo value/status to the cloud

Back on the wagon
=================
It's been a while since I worked on this. Adding DB features now so I can store state of kid's work.
